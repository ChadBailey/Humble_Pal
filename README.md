## BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD - IMPORTANT

### You Must Agree

By downloading you agree to being bound to the license agreements of Steam,
Humble Bundle, Origin, and any other associated game stores. Automation of
license acceptance does not alter in any way your legal binding to the
respective license agreements.

This means you are agreeing to the Steam subscriber agreement located at
<https://store.steampowered.com/checkout/ssapopup>.
Humble Pal automates duplicated requests to agree to the Steam Subscriber
Agreement, but does not absolve you from the responsibility of that
agreement. Your legal obligations to Steam and Humble Bundle are in no way
modified by the use of this software.

### Automated Redemption Account

With this extension installed, when clicking "Redeem" your keys will
automatically be redeemed to the currently logged in account. All key
activations are fully automated, so click wisely. Steam and others will likely
be unable to help with accidentally redeemed keys to the incorrect account.

If you attempt to redeem to an account that is not elegible for redemption in
error, Humble Pal will make the assumption that you already redeemed the key to
that account and mark it visually as redeemed to the account which it attempted
to redeem to. The key itself will remain unredeemed.

## Update Frequency

A quick note on update frequency. This project may appear to be abandoned but
it is not. I tend to only make updates to my software as I feel is absolutely
necessary, so I would go by the assumption that everything works as expected
and if it didn't an update of some kind would be made to reflect that. Even
if this is as simple as updating the page to say "this is broken, use at your
own risk" which I have been known to do occasionally when I do not have time or
am for some other reason unable/uninterested to produce an update.

### About & Usage

Humble Pal is an extension to improve the integration between Humble Bundle
and Steam. It automates the Steam key activation process and marks which
account Steam keys have been redeemed to.

Humble Pal also adds a search Steam store right click menu item when
highlighting text on Humble Bundle to make it easier to find the official
Steam store page of apps.

> NOTE: The Steam key activation website is automated regardless of if the
source is from a Humble Bundle link (and if the key is found on Humble Bundle
it will be marked accordingly). This is intentional behavior for now as some
users may prefer to only use the Steam automation (aka getting your keys from
Humble Bundle is not required to use the automation). If this behavior causes
problems it will be reduced.

### Issues & Contributing

All contribution types are welcomed and appreciated. Issues/bugs should be
submitted as a github issue. Please be sure to indicate if this bug is causing
a complete breakage of the product or just reduced functionality.
