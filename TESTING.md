# Testing

Testing is not yet actually testing the code, but I've used it to develop some
new functions I plan to incorporate into the base project. I do not plan to
have any dependency on heavy JS frameworks for the extension itself to run,
but to do proper TDD style development I felt it was necessary to use nodejs.

To run tests, issue the command `npm test`. For now using mocha, but I may
switch to jest. More to come soon...
