## Style Guide

- Text files should be a maximum of 80 characters wide unless there is an
  unusual circumstance to extend beyond that (such as a long url).

- Egyptian-style bracketing should be used

- Code blocks should not exceed 30 lines, minus HTML block content

- HTML block content should be abstracted out into constants if excessive
  (excessive intentionally not yet defined)
